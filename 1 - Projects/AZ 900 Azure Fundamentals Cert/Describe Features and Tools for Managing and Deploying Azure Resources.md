 Objectives:
- Describe the Azure portal.
- Describe Azure Cloud Shell, including Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell.
- Describe the purpose of Azure Arc.
	Azure Arc provides a centralized, unified way to:

	- Manage your entire environment together by projecting your existing non-Azure resources into ARM.
	- Manage multi-cloud and hybrid virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, and databases as if they are running in Azure.
	- Use familiar Azure services and management capabilities, regardless of where they live.
	- Continue using traditional ITOps while introducing DevOps practices to support new cloud and native patterns in your environment.
	- Configure custom locations as an abstraction layer on top of Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters and cluster extensions.

	Currently, arc can help manage the following hosted outside of Azure
	- Servers
	- Kubernetes clusters
	- Azure data services
	- SQL Server
	- Virtual machines (preview)

- Describe Azure Resource Manager (ARM), ARM templates, and Bicep. 
	- Bicep gets converted to ARM and then uploaded
	- Like YAML for Kubernetes
