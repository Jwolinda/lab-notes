I installed K9s via brew for a terminal UI:

## 1. Install Brew

https://brew.sh/
~~~
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
~~~

Follow instructions to add to path.
## 2. Install K9s

https://k9scli.io/topics/install/
~~~
brew install derailed/k9s/k9s
~~~

Immediately available on cluster.
